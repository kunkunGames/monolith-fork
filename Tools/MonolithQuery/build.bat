REM Build monolith_query.exe — standalone SQLite query tool
REM Run from VS Developer Command Prompt, or let it find cl.exe via vswhere

REM Compute a SHA256 of the source and inject its first 16 hex chars as
REM /DSOURCE_HASH so --version reports a hash the staleness guard can match.
REM certutil is built into Windows; its second output line is the bare hash.
REM Statements are kept un-nested so plain (non-delayed) %VAR% expansion works.
REM Build/copy failures are gated with conditional execution (||) rather than
REM %ERRORLEVEL% or "if errorlevel": || reads the real exit code of the command
REM it follows, so it fires on ANY non-zero -- including the negative codes a
REM cl.exe hard fault returns (e.g. -1073741819), which "if not errorlevel 1"
REM treats as success because that test is a signed >= comparison.
